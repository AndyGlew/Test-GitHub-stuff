# Test-GitHub-stuff
Repo to try out tests on GitHub stuff (and avoid corrupting working repos)

I see that you can edit  a Markdown file like README.md  in the  code repository online, without doing a get clone locally. 

Q: does a [[wiki link]] work?  Apparently not in the code repo -  although of course it does for the wiki.
